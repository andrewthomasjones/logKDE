According Chapters 5, 19, 20 @tukey1977exploratory, visualization data, density distributional characteristics, may provide practitioners great insight necessary processes required order effectively analyse various features data. Since introduction pioneering works @rosenblatt1956remarks @parzen1962estimation, method kernel density estimation (KDE) become among one popular methods estimation, interpolation, visualization probability density functions (PDFs), due effectiveness simplicity. manuscripts @silverman2018density @wand1994kernel provide thorough treatments topic KDE. base stats package R programming environment [@R2016], univariate KDE can conducted via function, density. function, density, often taught introductory R classes presented popular textbooks. See example Section 5.6 @venables1228bd, Section 7.4 @trosset2009introduction, Section 6.3 @keen2010graphics, Section 2.1 @maindonald2010data, Section 2.3 @verzani2014using. KDE method implemented density standard KDE technique estimation univariate PDFs, assuming data real-valued. Unfortunately, density often used analyze data real-valued, income data, positive-valued [cf, @charpentier2015log]. use density case positive-valued data causes obtained estimator PDF characterizes data integrate one, positive domain. implies provide incorrect specification data generating process. order mitigate aforementioned shortcoming density, @charpentier2015log, among others, suggested use kernel density estimators (KDEs), constructed log-normal kernel functions. log-transformed KDEs, log-KDEs brevity, bona fide PDFs positive domain, thus suited applications positive-valued data. logKDE package R provides functions conducting log-transformed KDE using log-KDEs, constructed log-normal, well log-transformations Epanechnikov, Laplace, logistic, triangular, uniform families kernel functions, main function, logdensity. function allows variety bandwidth methods, including Silverman’s rule thumb [cf. @silverman2018density], cross-validation natural log-transformation space, new rule thumb based comparison log-KDE log-normal fit. necessary, programmed various functionalities C++, integrated C++ codes using Rcpp [@eddelbuettel2013seamless]. greater speed, expense accuracy, also implemented fast Fourier transform version procedure, via function, logdensity_fft. two packages currently available, share similar features logKDE. first Ake [@RJ2016045], via ker = 'LN' setting dke.fun, second evmix [@hu2018evmix], via dbckden, setting bcmethod = 'logtrans'. Unlike logKDE, Ake offers log-transformed KDE constructed log-normal kernels. Although evmix allows construction log-KDEs using variety kernels, including currently available logKDE, permit use log-Laplace log-logistic kernels. Thus, respect variety kernels, packages something offer . believe key difference evmix logKDE user experience. logKDE, logdensity designed closely replicate syntax behavior density. Thus, users learnt use density quickly make use logdensity features. syntax dbckden dramatically different density. function allows many controls meant higher level users may overwhelm someone interested conducting KDE exploratory tool. Therefore, believe logdensity provides experience user friendly familiar dbckden.
