[![Downloads from the RStudio CRAN mirror](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/logKDE)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=logKDE)

The goal of logKDE is to efficiently compute Kernel density estimates in the log domain with a wide variety of kernels. In addition it provides two new BW estimators for use with strictly positive densities.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable build of logKDE from CRAN using the command below:

```{r gh-installation, eval = F}
install.packages("logKDE", repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')
```

## Example

This is a very basic example:

```{r example}
## load library
library(logKDE)

## strictly positive data
x<-rchisq(100,12)

## do KDE
y<-logdensity(x)

## what if we want it faster
y_fft<-logdensity_fft(x)

## Plot the two KDEs
plot(y)
grid()
plot(y_fft)
grid()
```
