# logKDE

The goal of logKDE is to efficiently compute Kernel Density Estimates in Log Domain with a wide variety of kernels. In addition it provides two new BW estimators for use with strictly positive densities.

## Installation

You can install logKDE from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andrewthomasjones/logKDE")
```

## Example

This is a very basic example:

```{r example}
## strictly positive data
x<-rchisq(1000,12)
## get BW
bw<-bw.logCV(x)
## do KDE
y<-logdensity(x, bw=bw)
## what if we want it faster
y_fft<-logdensity_fft(x, bw=bw) #density points are evenly spaced on scale
```
