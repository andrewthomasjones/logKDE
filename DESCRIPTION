Description: This package efficiently computes kernel density estimates in the log domain for strictly positive distributions. 
Support is provided for a variety of kernels (gaussian, epanechnikov, triangular, uniform, laplace, and logistic). In addition it provides two new bandwdith estimators for use with strictly positive densities.
